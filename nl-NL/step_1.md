The starter file has a library of useful images.

Click on the 'View and Add images' icon:

![An icon shaped like a piece of paper with top right corner folded over and a mountain scene on the paper.](images/view-add-images.png)

Scroll through the image library and make a note of the file name of an image you would like to use in your web page:

![The image library with beetle.jpg file shown.](images/image-gallery.png)

Add your image to the `<main></main>` in `index.html` so that it appears on your web page:

## --- code ---

language: html
filename: index.html
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 32
line_highlights: 35
--------------------------------------------------------

```
<!-- The main content for the web page goes between the main tags -->
<main>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. 
  <img src="beetle.jpg" alt="Description of the image.">
   
</main>
```
